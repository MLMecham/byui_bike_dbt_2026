# 🚲 BYU-I Bike dbt 2026

A one-hour warm-up before the dbt Labs workshop. You'll set up the same tools the workshop
uses (**WSL + dbt Fusion + VS Code**), then rebuild everything we learned this semester on
a small, made-up bike-rental dataset:

**seeds → sources → staging → dims + fact → tests**

Somewhere in this data are two crazy fast riders (miles per hour). Your tests will find them. 🐉

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph raw["seeds → your _raw dataset"]
        r1[(raw_riders)]
        r2[(raw_stations)]
        r3[(raw_rentals)]
    end
    subgraph stg["staging (views)"]
        s1[stg_riders]
        s2[stg_stations]
        s3[stg_rentals]
    end
    subgraph marts["marts (tables)"]
        d1[dim_riders]
        d2[dim_stations]
        d3[dim_date ⭐ free]
        f1[fct_rentals]
        m1[mart_station_weekends 🏆 stretch]
    end
    r1 --> s1 --> d1
    r2 --> s2 --> d2
    r3 --> s3
    s3 --> d1
    s3 --> f1
    d3 --> f1
    f1 --> m1
    d2 --> m1
```

## Before anything else

**Step 0: sign the dbt Labs consent form:** <https://www.getdbt.com/university-student-consent-form>

**You also need** your Google Cloud project, service account, and `bigquery-key.json` in your
`.dbt` folder. If you haven't done that yet, do
**[student_gcp_setup](https://github.com/MLMecham/student_gcp_setup)** first, then come back.

## The path

Each page links to the next one. Just keep clicking **Next →**.

| # | Page | What you do | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | [Install WSL + tools](docs/00_wsl.md) | Linux on Windows, then git, GitHub CLI, dbt Fusion, VS Code | 20–25 min |
| 1 | [Fork, clone, push](docs/01_fork_clone_push.md) | Your own copy of this repo, your own branch, first push | 5 min |
| 2 | [Profile + seed](docs/02_profile_and_seed.md) | Connect dbt to BigQuery, load the CSVs | 5 min |
| 3 | [Sources](docs/03_sources.md) | Tell dbt where the raw tables live | 5 min |
| 4 | [Staging](docs/04_staging.md) | Rename, cast, dedup, new column ×3 | 15 min |
| 5 | [Dims + fact](docs/05_marts.md) | Build the star schema | 10 min |
| 6 | [Tests](docs/06_tests.md) | Catch the bad rows. Fix staging. Go green. | 7 min |
| 7 | [Stretch: a mart](docs/07_stretch_mart.md) | Answer a real question | bonus |

**🎯 The goal for today is to finish staging (page 4).** Anything after that is great, and
whatever's left is fine to finish at home.

**Handy pages:** [Cheat sheet](docs/cheatsheet.md) ·
[SQL types + casting primer](docs/sql_types_and_casting.md) ·
[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)

Every page has the answers hidden in **▶ Solution** boxes. Try first, peek if stuck.
